# Metasploit auto auxiliary script (networkScanner)

networkScanner simplifies running multiple auxiliary modules on a specific set of Network IP targets. Running NetworkScanner within a penetration test can be very useful, for example to find open ports or vulnerable services within a local area network. 

The Metasploit framework offers lots of useful auxiliary modules to perform all the network scans. This script simply runs all the auxiliary modules specified in the config file against the specified Network IP targets. All settings can be modified per auxiliary module and new modules can be added easily.


## Usage

Modify the "config" file. Change the CHANGEME values in the "settings" key, otherwise those modules will not run.

``python msfenum.py [-h] [-t [THREADS]] TARGET_FILE``

  -t [THREADS], Number of threads
  

## Structure:
* logs/
  * Contains all results after running the script
* modules/
  * Contains all auxiliary module configuration
* config
  * Contains global configuration settings
* msfenum.log
  * Some logging generated when running networkScanner.py
* networkScanner.py
  * The main script

## Result example

All raw results generated by Metasploit are stored within seperate files in the "logs/" directory. If you specified a project name, this name is used as a folder name. Otherwise, the current unix timestamp is used.
